Data Visualizationâ€Šâ€”â€ŠPokÃ©mon Dataset Part-II
Welcome to the Next Post in the series of Data Visualization, & 2nd part of one of the most favorite and loved Cartoon of all time â€” PokÃ©monâ€¦

Gotta Catch â€™em Allâ€¦. (The Visualization Part -II of the dataset)ðŸ˜‰

In 1st Part we saw some interesting graphs related to the Generation of PokÃ©mon and tried to figure out relation of other fields with it. So continuing with this we are going to analyze few more graphs related to other fields..

Letâ€™s begin with some re-overview of the dataset as a refresher to see what we are going to analyze..

Fig 2:- Description of columns of PokÃ©mon Dataset

Fig 3:- PokÃ©mon Data Overview

Starting with some graphs related to type of PokÃ©mon..

Fig 4:- Count of PokÃ©mon based on Primary Type

We have seen a similar graph in Part 1 of PokÃ©mon Dataset at the time of analyzing Generation link on the Primary type of PokÃ©mon.

We can see here Water, Normal, Grass, Bug, and Psychic are the more common Primary type for PokÃ©mon whereas Flying seems to be a rare type for Type 1 PokÃ©mon.

Now Letâ€™s analyze what is the ability distribution for the type of PokÃ©monâ€¦

1.1 Attack VS Primary Type

Fig 5:- Count of PokÃ©mon based on attack group and Type

We can notice here the major portion for each type is occupied by groups 41â€“60,61â€“80 & 81â€“100. Also, the attack group 21â€“40 which was seen as a major part of our analysis with generation in part-1 has a very little contribution for each type.

The point to note here isâ€¦ Attack group 181â€“200 is present only for Bug and Psychic-type. Also, attack group 161â€“180 is present only for few types, and that too in very less count. Lastly, Flying-type has 1 each for 101â€“120, 21â€“40, 61â€“80 & 81â€“100 attack groupsâ€¦

1.2 Defense VS Primary Type

Fig 6:- Count of PokÃ©mon based on defense group and Type

Similar to Attack Group we can see Defense Group 41â€“60, 61â€“80 & 81â€“100 has a major share for all typesâ€¦ Also, 21â€“40 has a minor portion of all the types. We can also notice here that the top groups in range 161â€“200 do not have much PokÃ©mon.

Apart from this highest defense is 201â€“300 which is present only for Bug and Steel Type. If we go back to the Attack group Bug-type had the highest Attack group also. If we see for Flying-type, it had 1 each PokÃ©mon in different Attack group but here 3 out of 4 PokÃ©mon has the Defense Group of 61â€“80 and 1 for 21â€“40.

So we can say Most of the PokÃ©mon in each category has an average attack and Defense of 41â€“100.

1.3 HP VS Primary Type

Fig 7:- Count of PokÃ©mon based on HP group and Type

Contrary to first 2 graphs, here only 41â€“60 & 61â€“80 groups have major portion for all type of PokÃ©monâ€™s.. Group 81â€“100 has only major portions in top 3 types. Also, we notice here that highest group 200â€“300 has only 2 PokÃ©mon of Normal Type.

2nd and 3rd highest groups i.e. 181â€“200 and 161â€“180 also has only 1 and 2 PokÃ©mon in Psychic and Water types respectively. Flying Type has 1 each for 21â€“40 and 81â€“100 group and 2 for 61â€“80, which denotes Flying Type seems to be rare but they do not have very rare abilities.
